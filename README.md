#### Compiling

#####  Visual Studio
Open the project solution and running the project should compile the game successfully.
M Can be held to view path information aswell as hitboxes.

### Controls
Arrow keys for movement and menu navigation, Enter to select a menu option.

### Editor Controls
The Editor is controlled using the mouse as input, currently some editor functions are not working (Ex. Running the game in editor, filling empty tiles with nodes) These functions were working at one point but due to a minor refactor before the project was submitted they no longer work.
